# Akadi : Minecraft painting generator

# # Background

In the Minecraft video game you can create tables and put them on the walls as decoration.
There are 26 different paintings, each displaying their own image and one displaying back.
The game gets 27 images from a single image file in PNG format.
This file can be modified to display custom pictures in tables.
But it requires the use of an image editing software to cut, resize, and arrange all 27 images of paintings.

# # The project

Akadi is an application used to easily generate their own tables in Minecraft.
The goal is to modify each of the 27 images of paintings with a simple application.
So you can easily create the file containing all Minecraft tables with custom pictures or posters found on the internet etc ...
In this way, you will see tables in the game with a family photo or a landscape image that you choose.

# # How to use

Akadi is a "Noob Friendly" application that is very easy to use.

1. When launching the application, you will see displayed all the images used by default for Minecraft tables.
2. To change one, just click on it. A window will open for you to choose the new image you want to use.
3. Once the selected image will be displayed in a window of the size of the table. You can adjust it by dragging image or resizing with the mouse wheel.
4. When the adjustment is right for you, simply click on submit button. You will see the new image in the main window.
5. When you are satisfied of tables, you can generate the file that will be used by the game.
For this you have two options :
Either you build the single file by clicking the save button "Generate". In this case an image file will be generated, after that you have to place it in the used resource pack.
Either you build a resource pack by clicking on the save button "Generate pack". Do it if you don't use resource pack in game. The application will generate a folder that you then simply place in the "resourcepacks" game folder.
In both cases you can choose the resolution of the output with the drop in the menu bar.

Once done, you have to choose the resource pack that contains new tables in game options.
